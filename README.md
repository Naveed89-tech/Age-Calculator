## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS 
- FormWik ( Form validation manually)
- CSS flex 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The project initially seemed simple, but since I am currently learning React, I decided to develop it using React . I found it easier to perform validation using the 'useState' hook in React. However, as I am currently exploring the 'Formik' form react liabray [https://formik.org/docs/overview], I decided to utilize it for my project, particularly for implementing live form validation. Now, the form aligns perfectly with my vision and goals for the project.

## About Formik Introduction
Let's face it, forms are really verbose in React. To make matters worse, most form helpers do way too much magic and often have a significant performance cost associated with them. Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts:

1.  Getting values in and out of form state
2.  Validation and error messages
3.  Handling form submission

### Continued development

As I continue to progress in my journey of learning React, I plan to primarily focus on utilizing the different libraries  in my future projects. I firmly believe that learning by doing is the most effective approach to gaining a better understanding of complex concepts. By actively applying and experimenting with formik, I aim to deepen my knowledge and proficiency in React development.
